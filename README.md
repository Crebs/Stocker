# Setup

## Mac OS and Linux
### Install pip
`sudo easy_install pip`

### Install selenium
`pip install selenium`

### Install Anaconda
Anaconda速 is a package manager, an environment manager, a Python/R data science distribution.  In order to use some Machine learning and Data science libaries we can use the Andaconda installer to install Panda and SicPy stack (IPython, NumPy, Matplotlib,...).  After running the Anaconda速 installer, users will have access to panda and the rest of the ScipPy stack without needing to install anything else, and with needing to wait for any software to complie. To install Anaconda速 via the installer follow the instuctions on their website [here](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install/mac-os/#). Refer to Anaconda-Starter-Guide.pdf as a cheat sheet.  

After you install Anaconda速 you may need to restart/refresh you terminal.

### Done
In the words of the infamous Porky Pig, "That's all Folks!".  Your environment should be ready to use Stocker.
